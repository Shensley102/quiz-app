      "rationale": "While less common than with barbiturates or benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem can also contribute to hangover (residual sedation) effects. Excess sedation would not be an indication of substance use disorder with zolpidem. Tolerance refers to a reduced drug effect requiring larger amounts of the drug to get the desired effect. Withdrawal occurs when stopping the drug causes symptoms that can only be alleviated by taking the drug.",

      ],
      "rationale": "Dopamine at moderate doses increases cardiac output and can improve renal perfusion, reflected by increased urine output. An increase in heart rate to 110 could be a side effect if excessive. Cool extremities suggest peripheral vasoconstriction (not necessarily desired, could indicate high-dose effect or inadequate perfusion). Appetite is unrelated to acute dopamine effects in a shock context.",

It’s safe to take acetaminophen separately as long as the total dose of acetaminophen from all sources does not exceed the recommended maximum (generally 3,000–4,000 mg per day, with 3,000 mg being a safer threshold). The nurse should help the patient calculate their intake. Saying Tylenol is “fine” without qualification is unsafe because of potential overdose. It’s not absolutely forbidden to take any Tylenol, but the total must be limited. Suggesting ibuprofen is an alternative for a headache, but the key is to educate about total acetaminophen dosing rather than outright banning it.",

While newer statins (including atorvastatin) have long half-lives and can be taken any time, evening dosing is traditional especially for shorter-acting statins. There’s no need to split the dose unless directed. Taking it with the evening meal or at bedtime optimizes its effect.",
