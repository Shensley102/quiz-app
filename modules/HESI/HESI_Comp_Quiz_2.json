In preparation for EGD, the client's throat is usually sprayed with an anesthetic to dampen the gag reflex and permit the introduction of the endoscope used to visualize the gastrointestinal structures. No food or oral fluids are given to the client until the gag reflex is fully intact. Vital signs are checked frequently, but this action is not associated with giving the client oral fluids. The client may be asked to use throat lozenges or a saline gargle to relieve a sore throat after the test, but neither action is related to giving the client oral fluids; additionally, neither action would be taken until the gag reflex had been detected again. Bowel sounds are not affected by this test.",
