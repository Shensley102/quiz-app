Stopping it would cause levels to drop again. The patient should indeed report signs of overtreatment like chest pain or tachycardia (possible hyperthyroid symptoms from excessive dose). Also, consistency in brand is important because different brands or generics may vary slightly in potency; any switch should be monitored with lab tests. So option c indicates misunderstanding.",

Frequent blood glucose checks are not relevant to magnesium therapy. The patient on mag sulfate (often a preeclamptic woman) will usually be on bed rest (mag causes sedation and fall risk). Magnesium must be given via controlled infusion pump, not rapidly (rapid infusion can cause cardiac or respiratory arrest). Priority is safety: have the antidote available.",
