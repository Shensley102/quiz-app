Important allopurinol teaching: (1) Continue during acute attacks (don't start during an attack, but don't stop if already taking), (2) Takes weeks-months to lower uric acid, (3) Increase fluids to 3L/day to prevent kidney stones, (4) May require dose adjustment in renal impairment.",

Both findings warrant holding the medication and notifying the provider. Methotrexate requires close monitoring: (1) CBC and liver function tests before starting and regularly during therapy, (2) Chest X-ray baseline (pulmonary toxicity risk), (3) Folic acid supplementation to reduce toxicity. Other important points: (1) Taken weekly (not daily) for RA—wrong frequency is a common error, (2) Highly teratogenic—strict contraception required, (3) Avoid alcohol (hepatotoxicity), (4) Avoid NSAIDs when possible (increases methotrexate toxicity).",
