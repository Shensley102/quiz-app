Health care errors have been widely reported for 25 years, many of which result in client injury, death, and increased health care costs. There are several national and international organizations that have either recommended or mandated safety initiatives. Every nurse has the responsibility to guard the client's safety. The other actions are important for quality nursing, but they are not as vital as providing safety. Not making medication errors does provide safety, but is too narrow in scope to be the best answer.",

An experienced AP would know how to take vital signs and the nurse would not have to assess this at this point. Double-checking the work defeats the purpose of delegation.

Dehydration increases the risk for supersaturation of calcium in the urine, which contributes to stone formation. The nurse would encourage the client to drink more fluids, not decrease calcium intake. Ingestion of aspirin or aspirin-containing products does not cause a stone.
