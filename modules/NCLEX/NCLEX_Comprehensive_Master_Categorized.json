This surgery involves removal of the prostate gland by an abdominal incision with a bladder incision. Phenothiazines are a class of antipsychotic medications. Antidyskinetics have an anticholinergic action and are used to treat Parkinson's disease and some of the acute movement disorders that may be caused by antipsychotic agents. Benzodiazepines are central nervous system (CNS) depressants and can cause sedation and psychomotor slowing. They can also intensify depression caused by other drugs. Benzodiazepines have some potential for abuse and should be used with caution in clients known to abuse alcohol or other psychoactive medications.",
