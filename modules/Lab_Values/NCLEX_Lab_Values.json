        "C": "Serum sodium 142 mEq/L",
        "D": "Decreased urine output"
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "rationale": "A serum sodium of 142 mEq/L is within normal range (135-145 mEq/L), indicating successful treatment of hypernatremia. A sodium of 152 mEq/L remains elevated. Increased confusion suggests worsening condition. Decreased urine output may indicate inadequate hydration."

        "D": "Calcium 11.2 mg/dL"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "rationale": "U waves on ECG, along with muscle cramps and weakness, are classic signs of hypokalemia. A potassium of 2.9 mEq/L (below normal 3.5-5.0 mEq/L) correlates with these findings. Hyperkalemia causes peaked T waves. The symptoms described are not typical of sodium or calcium imbalances."

        "D": "Shortened QT interval on ECG"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "rationale": "Chvostek's sign (facial twitching when tapping the facial nerve) is a classic indicator of hypocalcemia, which can occur after parathyroidectomy due to removal of or damage to parathyroid glands. Constipation and bone pain occur with hypercalcemia. Decreased reflexes occur with hypermagnesemia. Shortened QT occurs with hypercalcemia."

        "D": "Administer loop diuretics"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "rationale": "Normal calcium is 8.5-10.5 mg/dL. A level of 7.2 mg/dL indicates hypocalcemia, which can cause tetany and seizures. Seizure precautions are the priority safety intervention. Ambulation is encouraged for hypercalcemia. Restricting calcium and loop diuretics are interventions for hypercalcemia."

        "D": "Administering potassium supplements"
      },
      "answer": "B",
      "rationale": "Hypercalcemia treatment includes IV normal saline for hydration followed by loop diuretics (furosemide) to promote calcium excretion. The mnemonic for hypercalcemia symptoms is 'stones, bones, groans, thrones, and psychiatric overtones.' Calcium gluconate would worsen hypercalcemia. Fluid restriction is contraindicated."
