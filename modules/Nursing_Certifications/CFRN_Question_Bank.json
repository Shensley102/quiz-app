Mid-flight, you notice increasing peak inspiratory pressures. What is the most appropriate immediate action to take?",

      "rationale": "The first step when noticing increasing peak inspiratory pressures is to check for mechanical issues such as kinks or obstructions in the ventilator tubing. This is essential because such issues can cause sudden increases in pressure and need to be ruled out before considering other interventions. Increasing tidal volume (A) could exacerbate high pressures and worsen lung injury. Decreasing PEEP (B) might compromise oxygenation without addressing the underlying cause. Administering a bronchodilator (D) is not an immediate first step and would be more appropriate if bronchospasm was suspected after ruling out mechanical causes.",

Option B (Establish communication with local emergency services): Communication is important but secondary to ensuring immediate safety from hazards. Option D (Start administering life-saving interventions to the most critically injured patient): Providing care is essential but must follow initial hazard assessment to avoid further casualties.",
